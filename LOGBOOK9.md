## Secret Key Encryption Lab

#### Task 1

First, we tested the encryption:
After creating a ```plain.txt``` file with the phrase ```O objetivo do trabalho esta semana é abordar temáticas relacionadas com criptografia simétrica```, we ran the command:

> $ tr ’abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’ ’sxtrwinqbedpvgkfmalhyuojzc’ < plain.txt > ciphertext.txt

And the result was : ```O kxewhbuk rk hasxspqk wlhs lwvsgs é sxkarsa hwváhbtsl awpstbkgsrsl tkv tabfhknasibs lbvéhabts```.



Finding out plain text:


#### Task 2

- When encrypting, which flags did you need to specify? What is the difference between these different modes?

- When decrypting, which flags did you need to specify? What is the main difference between AES-128-CTR and the other modes?
